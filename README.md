## Customize

By default, this extension gets word's definition from "New Oxford American Dictionary".  
To customize that, you should open Finder and navigate to "~/Library/Application Support/PopClip/Extensions/", control+click "EvernoteDictionary.popclipext", "Show Package Contents", you will find an "EvernoteDictionary.app".  
You may need to copy that out, then use Automator.app to open that, change dictionary source, save it.
Copy that modified app back.
